Dear Mona,

I hope this email finds you well. Thank you for bringing the network issue to our attention. We understand the importance of resolving this matter promptly, and I would like to update you on the steps we are taking to address it.

Network Team Involvement:
We have already raised a request to the network team to investigate and troubleshoot the issue from the network side. I'm pleased to inform you that they have acknowledged the problem and are actively working on it. To ensure a comprehensive approach, they have created a dedicated group that will focus on debugging the issue during its next occurrence, which typically happens on weekends.

Query Modification:
Following Raj's suggestion during our call, we will be modifying the query we currently monitor. It has come to our attention that some backend jobs are running on the DB servers during weekends, which might be contributing to the issue. By making this adjustment, we aim to eliminate any potential conflicts and streamline the monitoring process. To ensure smooth cooperation between our teams, we will include Vinitha from your team in the group, so we can seek assistance if necessary during the troubleshooting process.

Moving forward, we will closely observe the issue and keep you updated on our progress. Our priority is to identify the root cause and implement effective solutions to prevent future occurrences.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We appreciate your cooperation and patience as we work through this matter.

Best regards,
