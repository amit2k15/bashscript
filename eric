Hi Brad,
As discussed, I wanted to reach out and propose a recurring meeting(bi-weekly) schedule to discuss various aspects related to Zabbix and Grafana. As a team, we believe that frequent communication is essential to address challenges, requirements, current state, and any show stoppers we encounter in our day-to-day activities. Our objective is to continuously improve and enhance the visibility of these tools.
Agenda:
Disucssion on new features, functionalities, or improvements that may be required to meet our evolving needs.
To identify and address any obstacles or difficulties encountered while working with Zabbix and Grafana.
Sharing updates on the current status of our Zabbix and Grafana deployments.
Exploring opportunities to optimize Zabbix and Grafana, making them more user-friendly and providing better visibility for monitoring purposes.
By collaborating regularly, we can ensure that our Zabbix and Grafana implementations align with best practices and contribute to the overall success of our organization.
Please let us know your availability and preferred time slots for the recurring meetings or if you want i can check your calander and schedule a recurring meeting for the same.
Thank you for considering this proposal, and we look forward to working closely with you to improve and enhance our Zabbix and Grafana.
