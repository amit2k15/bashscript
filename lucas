Hi Abilash,
I wanted to provide you with an update regarding our previous discussion on server deployment and the installation of the Zabbix proxy. As per your suggestion, we have successfully deployed a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 server and installed the Zabbix proxy on it.
I have been closely monitoring the server and its performance for the past 10 days, so far I haven't encountered any issues other than the "telnet" package(automatically removed from the system within a certain interval). The server and the Zabbix proxy are functioning smoothly. 
As we discussed earlier, I would like to proceed with the next step of our plan, which involves working on the Chef script for automating zabbix proxy builds which will help us to streamline the process and ensure consistency across our server deployments.
I kindly request you to review and work on the Chef script as discussed. If any additional information or specific requirements are needed, please let us know.
Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your positive response.
