Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing in response to our previous discussion with the OWCA team regarding the Zabbix service discovery on Windows machines.

As agreed with the OWCA team, we have configured all the services on the OWCA servers to be in a disabled state. This step ensures security and minimizes potential risks. However, we understand that certain application teams might require specific services to be enabled for their applications to function optimally.

I have reviewed the ticket you mentioned, and I can confirm that Zabbix successfully discovered the service "A" on the target server, and it is currently in a disabled state. However, we are currently facing difficulties in identifying the "B" service using Zabbix.

To proceed with troubleshooting and resolving the issue, we kindly request you to provide us with the exact service name or any additional information that could assist us in locating the "B" service within Zabbix.

Once we have the necessary details, our team will promptly investigate and take appropriate actions to ensure smooth service management and monitoring on the OWCA servers.

Please feel free to share any further insights or queries you may have. We are committed to providing a swift resolution to the matter at hand.

Thank you for your cooperation, and we look forward to your response.

Best regards,
