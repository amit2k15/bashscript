Dear Dan,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update regarding the alert analysis that you requested. I have thoroughly investigated the situation and wanted to share my findings with you.

Upon conducting a detailed review, I discovered that there is a maintenance window configured in Zabbix for the DB server. This maintenance window is scheduled daily from 12 AM to 3 AM CST. As a result, Zabbix does not trigger any email notifications during this time frame. This information explains why some alerts have not been received during these hours.

After examining the alerts from the last 30 days, I can confirm that alerts for components A and B have been triggered appropriately outside of the maintenance window. Additionally, I observed some issues related to the Daemon process. It seems that the issue may be stemming from the every 15-minute alert policy.

In response to this, I have taken the following steps:

I have temporarily removed the every 15-minute alert policy to prevent any further disruptions caused by the issue.
I have enabled alerting to trigger once the issue occurs, ensuring that alerts are generated when needed.
In parallel, our team is actively investigating the periodic alerting policy to identify any underlying issues.
