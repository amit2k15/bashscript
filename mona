Hi Rakshitha/Team,

I hope this email finds you well. We wanted to provide an update on the issue we've been facing every 15 days and the progress made in resolving it. As per our previous communication, we have raised a request to the Network Team to investigate and troubleshoot the recurring issue.

In response to our request, the Network Team has agreed to collaborate with us during the next occurrence of the problem. To facilitate a smooth and efficient resolution, we have created a joint group comprising members from both teams. The purpose of this group is to collectively identify and address the root cause of the issue.

Now, we kindly request your assistance in identifying a suitable resource from your team who will be available during the upcoming weekend. Adding this resource to the joint group will enable a more comprehensive examination of the issue and foster a collaborative approach to finding a solution.

Please provide us with the name and contact details of the team member who will be available during the upcoming weekend. Additionally, if there are any preferred times or methods of communication for the troubleshooting session, do let us know so that we can plan accordingly.

We understand the importance of resolving this issue promptly, and we believe that the combined expertise of both teams will significantly contribute to its successful resolution.

Thank you for your cooperation and support. We look forward to working together and resolving the matter expeditiously.
