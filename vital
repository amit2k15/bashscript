Discussed Items:

Zabbix Tool:
We delved into various aspects of the Zabbix Monitoring tool, including its functionalities and features. The following points were discussed:

Zabbix Monitoring tool functionalities and features.
The list of Hosts/Servers currently being monitored in Zabbix for vital points.
Monitoring parameters captured in Zabbix, along with alert thresholds.
The decision to temporarily disable service monitoring for certain servers to avoid unnecessary alerts.
Feasibility of implementing SQL query monitoring using Zabbix.
Action Items:

The Zabbix team will categorize the servers based on their respective environments (Dev, Test, Stage, Prod) to focus on vital points effectively.
Rajshekhar will liaise with the team to gather detailed requirements for DB query monitoring. Once gathered, he will communicate the information to the Zabbix team for further action.
The Zabbix team is responsible for sharing the monitoring data with the application team. The application team will review the data for any gaps in monitoring and provide feedback to the Zabbix team to ensure comprehensive server coverage.
We believe that these action items will enhance our monitoring capabilities and improve the overall efficiency of our systems. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the discussed items or action points.

Thank you for your attention to these matters, and we look forward to our continued collaboration.
