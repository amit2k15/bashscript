Hi Sheryl,
I am writing to seek your approval for a change request regarding the SSL certificate renewal for our ORX-Zabbix Prod Zabbix instance, scheduled to take place tomorrow 1:30 AM CST time.
Our current SSL certificate is set to expire on 24th May, and it is essential to renew it to avoid any disruptions of Zabbix Prod instance.
Change Request Details:

Request Type: SSL Certificate Renewal
System: ORX-Zabbix (Prod Zabbix Instance)
Impact: Low 
Scheduled Date: 13th May 1:30 AM CST
The certificate renewal process involves the following steps:
Step1: Generate a new Certificate from Venafi Portal(Done)
Step2: install the renewed SSL certificate on the ORX-Zabbix Prod Zabbix instance.
Step3: Validate the Zabbix dashboard and access
