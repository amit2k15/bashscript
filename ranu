I am writing to apologize for the recent alerts that were triggered regarding the DB monitors configured in Zabbix. Upon investigation, we have discovered that there were no actual issues with the databases, and the alerts were triggered erroneously.
Let me provide you with some background information. We have set up a data capture system through Zabbix proxy, which collects data from the databases and syncs it with the Zabbix server. The purpose of configuring alert triggers in Zabbix was to notify the concerned team if there is no response from the database for 900 seconds.
Unfortunately, during the recent incident, we encountered a data synchronization issue between the Zabbix proxy and the Zabbix server. This issue led to the false triggering of alerts, creating confusion and unnecessary alarm within the team. 
we are currently working  to identify the root cause of the data synchronization problem. We understand the importance of ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our monitoring systems, and we will take necessary measures to prevent such scenarios in the future.
We appreciate your understanding and patience during this time. please feel free to reach out to us in case any issues or concerns.
