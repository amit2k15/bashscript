Hi Shaheed/Edith,

Thank you so much for your tremendous efforts and support in conducting the Phase 1 activity. 
As suggested, we have pointed our application to the Master node for time being and will wait for your updates on replica servers so that we can replace the Master node with the proxy in the Zabbix configuration. We understand that this process may take some time, but we appreciate your efforts to keep us updated on its progress.
I would also like to bring to your attention about the data gap for a few servers that we have identified due to the read-only mode while starting the application. Going forward We will ensure to validate the same on production migration to ensure everything is in order.
Once again, thank you for your support.
