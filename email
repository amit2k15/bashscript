Dear [Insurance Company Name],

I trust this email finds you well. I am writing to address the deficiency document I received regarding the cancelled check requirement. The deficiency mentioned that the original cancelled check must bear my name.

Currently, I do not possess a cheque book with my name on it. Following a discussion with your support team, I was advised to submit my latest month's bank statement, which indeed contains my name. I have attempted to upload this document on the portal, but unfortunately, it is neither uploading nor providing any error message. The only feedback I am receiving is as follows:

To ensure the completion of my submission, I am attaching the latest month's bank statement to this email. Kindly review the attached document and assist me in uploading it to the portal.

If there are any specific guidelines or alternative methods for submitting the required document, please provide detailed instructions. Additionally, please inform me if any further documents or information are needed from my side to resolve this matter promptly.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your guidance on completing the document submission successfully.

Thank you for your assistance.
