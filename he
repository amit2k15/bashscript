Hi Srini/Jagesh,

As discussed, Alert and notification has been configured for Jboss log monitoring alerts with the following conditions:
If there is an entry in the log with the keyword "ERROR" in the last 15 minutes, an alert will be triggered.
As you stated earlier you need to implement the same monitoring for production servers as well as IKA Application. Kindly provide us the details of production servers so that we can start onboard those monitors in Zabbix.
Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns about this request.
