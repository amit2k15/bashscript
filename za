Subject: Successful Zabbix Upgrade POC and Load Test Results

Dear Team,

I'm pleased to inform you that we have successfully completed the Zabbix upgrade proof of concept (POC) from version 5.0 to 6.0, along with conducting extensive load testing involving 1500 servers and implementing application-level high availability (HA) measures.

Key highlights of our testing include:

- Successful upgrade from Zabbix 5.0 to 6.0 with no major issues encountered.
- Load testing involving 1500 servers showed that the system was able to handle the increased load effectively.
- Monitoring of web and application servers indicated normal levels of activity throughout the testing period.
- Traffic was routed seamlessly for nearly 2 hours without any disruptions or performance degradation.

Overall, the results of our testing demonstrate the robustness and reliability of the upgraded Zabbix system, as well as our ability to manage and maintain high levels of performance under demanding conditions.

Please feel free to reach out if you require any further information or clarification regarding our testing process or results.

Best regards,
