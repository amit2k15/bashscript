Dear Jim,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to update you on the analysis of the alerts for the tpau2prod system over the last three months. I have completed a thorough review and I'm pleased to inform you that the alerts have been triggering as expected during this period.

After careful investigation, I've observed that both the Interlink notifications and email notifications have been configured to the following Distribution Lists (DLs):

Interlink Notifications DL: [DL Name/Address]
Email Notifications DL: [DL Name/Address]
I have attached a comprehensive alerting dump spanning the last three months to this email. This dump includes detailed information about the triggered alerts, their timestamps, and relevant data. Please take some time to review the attached document and let us know if you have any feedback or if there are any changes you would like to suggest.

If you require any additional information or have any questions regarding the analysis or the provided dump, please feel free to reach out to me. Your insights and input are valuable to ensure the continued effectiveness of our alerting system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and any further instructions you may have.
