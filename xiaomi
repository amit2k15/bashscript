Dear Xiaomi Customer Support Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention an issue I recently encountered with my Redmi Note 9 Pro Max and my subsequent visit to a nearby Mi service center.

Over the past few days, I noticed a problem with the charging port of my phone; it seemed to be slightly loose. Unfortunately, this issue escalated to the point where my phone completely stopped charging this morning. However, it's important to note that the phone was functioning perfectly until the battery completely drained.

In response to this issue, I promptly visited the nearest Mi service center to seek assistance. Upon inspection, the service center representative took my phone and informed me that there was a problem with the charging port and the backed strip. I was told that the repair would cost approximately INR 1400, which I was willing to pay to have my phone restored to working condition.

During my interaction with the service center representative, I inquired about the estimated repair time. To my surprise, I was informed that if I chose to proceed without a bill, the repair could be completed immediately. However, if I opted for a bill, the repair would take 1 to 2 hours. This raised some questions and concerns on my part:

Difference between With and Without Bill: I am curious to understand why there is a discrepancy in the repair time based on whether I choose to receive a bill or not. The nature of the problem remains the same, and it seems logical that the repair time should be consistent regardless of the billing option.

Spare Part Costs: Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide me with a breakdown of the costs associated with the spare parts that were replaced in my phone. During my visit to the service center, I was not provided with a clear explanation or itemized list of these costs. Having transparency in this matter would greatly assist in understanding the overall repair charges.

I value your assistance in resolving this matter and ensuring a transparent and fair process for all Xiaomi customers. I look forward to your prompt response, addressing the above concerns and providing clarity on the repair process and associated costs.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I hope to have a positive resolution to my inquiry.
