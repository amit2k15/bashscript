Dear Mona,

I hope this email finds you well. Thank you for bringing the network issue to our attention. I want to inform you that I have cross-verified with our network team, and it appears that there is no issue on the network end.

However, during our investigation of the issue, we made an interesting observation. It seems that we are not receiving a timely response from the query, which is causing timeout errors in Zabbix. These timeout errors, in turn, trigger the alerts.

To further investigate this matter, could you please cross-check if any tasks or processes are running in the background during the weekends that might be affecting the response time of the query? It's possible that some background tasks are causing delays in query responses.

Your assistance in checking this will greatly help us pinpoint the root cause of the issue and work towards a resolution.

If you have any findings or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. We are committed to resolving this issue as swiftly as possible.

Thank you for your cooperation.
