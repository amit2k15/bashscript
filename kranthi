Dear Kranthi,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to extend my sincere appreciation for your valuable support during the recent load test. As you are aware, we have encountered a specific error after routing the traffic from the existing production environment to the new proof of concept (POC) setup that we created using the latest backup.

Up until this point, we have conducted multiple rounds of testing, approximately 3 to 4 times, where we did not observe any issues. During our recent call, we discussed routing the traffic back to the earlier POC database that you had initially set up 15-20 days ago. We executed a load test that lasted approximately 3 hours and, fortunately, we did not encounter any issues during this test.

I wanted to share with you some of the observations and system utilization data from the load test conducted today. It would be greatly appreciated if you could also share your observations from the database perspective. This information will be crucial as we move forward with our upgrade plans.

Load Test Observations:

Date and Time: [Insert Date and Time]
Error Encountered: [Describe the error in detail]
System Utilization: [Provide system utilization statistics, such as CPU, memory, disk usage, etc.]
Other Observations: [Include any other relevant observations or information]
As we discussed, it's imperative that we conduct another round of testing next weekend to ensure a smooth transition from the existing setup to the new one. Your continued support and expertise are invaluable as we work through these challenges and strive for a successful upgrade.

Thank you once again for your dedication and assistance in this critical phase of our project. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further insights or suggestions regarding our testing and the upcoming upgrade.

Looking forward to your feedback and our continued collaboration.

Best regards,
