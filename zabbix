Hi All,
I am thrilled to announce that we have successfully completed the migration of our Zabbix stage instance to the latest version(Zabbix 6.0). The migration process was executed seamlessly, and we now have access to enhanced features and improvements offered by the upgraded Zabbix version.
The upgraded Zabbix version brings several benefits, including improved performance, enhanced security measures, and additional features that will empower our team to monitor our infrastructure more effectively. 
Over the next few days, we will closely monitor the performance and stability of the upgraded Zabbix stage instance. This observation period will allow us to gain valuable insights into the new version's behavior in our specific environment and validate its compatibility with our existing systems and workflows. We will pay close attention to any potential issues or unexpected behavior during this phase.
Post to the close observation on the upgraded Zabbix version on the stage environment, we will proceed with planning the implementation on our production environment. We understand the importance of a seamless production deployment, and we aim to keep the impact on our users and services to a minimum.
