Here's an explanation of what this query does:

We select the columns hostname, item_name, hostid, itemid, lastvalue, and lastclock from the hosts and items tables.

We join the hosts table (aliased as h) with the items table (aliased as i) on the hostid column to relate hosts to their corresponding items.

We use the WHERE clause to filter results for a specific item. Replace 'your_item_key' with the actual key of the item you're interested in.

We order the results by lastclock in descending order, so the most recent data appears first.

Finally, we use LIMIT 1 to retrieve only the latest record.

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Zabbix database, and replace 'your_item_key' with the actual key of the item you want to query. Additionally, you may need to adjust the table and column names if your Zabbix database uses a different naming convention or schema.
