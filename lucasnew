Dear Lucas,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update regarding the Zabbix server monitoring for both the X and Y servers.

Upon conducting a thorough cross-verification, I can confirm that monitoring is enabled for both the X and Y servers in Zabbix. Additionally, alerting mechanisms have been successfully implemented, with a defined threshold of 95% for disk space alerts.

Furthermore, during my investigation, I discovered that an alert was triggered on the Y server due to disk space issues on the 8th of August. This indicates that the monitoring and alerting system is functioning as expected and promptly notifying us of critical events.

Should you require any further details or have any specific questions about the monitoring setup or the alert triggered on the Y server, please feel free to reach out. I'm here to assist you with any additional information or actions that may be necessary.
