Hi Guy,

Following the incident created by Kedar, I have temporarily disabled monitoring for the specified servers in Zabbix. After cross-verifying the alerts, I found they were triggered due to a lack of response from the query for over 10 minutes. This aligns with our Zabbix configuration, which sends an alert if no response is received within that time.

As you mentioned, there was no issue on the database side. This might suggest that network latency could have caused the delay. I will investigate further and coordinate with Kedar to validate, after which I will re-enable monitoring.

Thank you for your patience.
