Dear Kedar,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I have recently raised a ticket with the Grafana team regarding the availability of Windows Server Authentication for SQL DB on the Grafana platform. As of now, this feature is not supported, and I have expressed the need for its development.

I have received confirmation from the Grafana support team that they have acknowledged the feedback and taken the necessary steps to address this concern. They have escalated the matter to their internal development team to explore the possibility of implementing the Windows Server Authentication feature for SQL DB in Grafana.

Please note that the implementation of this feature may take some time, as it involves development, testing, and ensuring compatibility with the existing functionalities of Grafana. However, I want to assure you that your feedback has been registered, and the Grafana team is actively working towards providing a solution.

I will keep you updated on any progress or updates received from the Grafana team regarding this matter. In the meantime, if you have any additional questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me. I am here to assist you.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. We value your feedback, as it helps us improve our services and better cater to our users' needs. We will strive to keep you informed and deliver a solution that aligns with your requirements.

Best regards,
