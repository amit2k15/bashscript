Hi Barry,
I wanted to follow up on our recent discussion regarding the raised RITM (). As you aware we are belonging to M&I team and we are responsible for monitoring multiple systems using the Zabbix tool.
Zabbix is a powerful open-source monitoring solution that allows us to collect, analyze, and visualize data from various devices and systems in our environment. The tool provides a centralized web-based interface for configuration, monitoring, and analysis of performance data. The Zabbix tool consists of multiple components such as the App, Web, DB, and Proxies (Gateway servers). Currently we are leveraging Zabbix proxy which is a lightweight component that can collect data from multiple devices and send it to the Zabbix server for further processing. This will help us in reducing the load on the Zabbix server and provide us with more accurate and timely monitoring data.
We would like to bring to your attention that the support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 is ending soon, and management has decided to move from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8. As part of this upgrade, we anticipate that changing the Zabbix Proxy IP across thousands of devices will be a time-consuming process. In order to mitigate this challenge, we have been exploring the feasibility of switching the IP from the old server to the new server, rather than changing it individually on each device. This approach would save us significant time and effort, ensuring a smoother transition to RHEL 8.
We would appreciate your support for this activity, and we are open to discussing the technical details and potential impact of this change. Please let us know if you have any concerns or questions, and we would be happy to provide additional information.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to working together to ensure a seamless upgrade of our Zabbix tool and its components.
