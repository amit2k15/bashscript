**Subject: Scheduled Maintenance for Zabbix Proxy - Monthly Activity**

Dear Juan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to inform you that we have a scheduled monthly maintenance activity for one of our Zabbix proxies. This maintenance is essential to ensure the continued reliability and performance of our monitoring infrastructure.

**Maintenance Details:**
- **Date:** [Insert Date]
- **Time:** [Insert Time]
- **Duration:** [Insert Duration]

During this maintenance window, the Zabbix proxy will be temporarily unable to fetch metrics from the monitored servers. As a result, you will notice a gap in the graphs and data collection for the affected period.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding as we perform this necessary maintenance.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,

[Your Name]  
[Your Position]  
[Your Contact Information]
