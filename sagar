Dear [SSO Team],

I hope this email finds you well. As discussed in our previous conversation, our team is planning to migrate our Zabbix Stage instance from version 5.0 to version 6.0. Additionally, senior leadership has made the decision to migrate our backend servers from RHEL 7 to RHEL 9. Along with these changes, we will also be updating the existing Stage application URL from https://stage-zabbix.optum.com to https://orxzabbix-stage.optum.com.

To ensure a smooth transition, we kindly request your assistance in integrating SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) with our new Stage instance. The integration with SSO is crucial for our security and access management requirements. We aim to decommission the existing Stage instance once the Zabbix Stage upgrade to version 6.0 is completed successfully.

In line with your recommendation, I have created a new Requested Item (RITM) and filled out the provided form with the relevant details. The RITM will help track the progress of this integration request.

We understand that you have multiple responsibilities and appreciate your support in prioritizing this request. If you require any additional information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We look forward to working together to accomplish this migration successfully.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and we appreciate your prompt action.
