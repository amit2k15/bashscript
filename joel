Hi Joel,
There is no signficant change in the minor version of Zabbix agents (Ex: v5.0.14, v5.0.34). The newer version of Zabbix is backward compatible with older Zabbix agents. This means that your existing Zabbix agents will continue to function properly even after the upgrade to Zabbix 6.0.
We have thoroughly tested the compatibility of the older Zabbix agent version with Zabbix 6.0 in our testing environment, and we haven't encountered any major issues or compatibility conflicts. 
We are currently in the process of upgrading our Zabbix application from version 5.0 LTS  to the latest version, 6.0 LTS and will keep you posted on the same.
If you have any further questions or require additional information, please feel free to reach us.
