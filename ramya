During my time at Ctrls datacenters, I was responsible for handling and designing private cloud setups for monitoring purposes. i got the opertunity to find out the best opensource monitoring tool for datacenters and infrastructure so i explored many tools and then I introduced Zabbix as an open-source tool for various business units, including SAP, banking, and enterprise customers. This initiative proved to be successful and enhanced the monitoring capabilities for the organization.
