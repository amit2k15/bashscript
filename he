Dear Team,

During our recent meeting, we discussed the various features of Zabbix that can be used for infrastructure, log, and database monitoring. as well as the application onboarding process. Please review the following highlights from our discussion:
Zabbix Features:

Infrastructure Monitoring: Zabbix allows you to monitor the status of servers and other infrastructure components with metrics such as CPU, Memory, Disk, Filesystem, services and ports
Log Monitoring: Zabbix can also monitor log files generated by applications or services. You can set up triggers to alert you when specific events occur in the logs.
Database Monitoring: Zabbix can monitor the performance and health of databases such as MySQL, Oracle, MSSQL etc. You can monitor key metrics like query execution time, buffer usage, and cache hits, custom queries and set up triggers to alert you when these metrics exceed certain thresholds.
Onboarding Process:

Monitoring requirement analysis: The onboarding process starts with a session where we gather information about the application to be monitored. This includes details about the infrastructure, log and database files and other aspects that need monitoring.
Working Session: The onboarding process starts with a working session where we are helping application team to install Zabbix agent in respective machine with detailed SOP
Demo Session: We then set up a demo session in Zabbix to show you how the monitoring will work for your application.
If you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the discussed topics, please feel free to reach us.
